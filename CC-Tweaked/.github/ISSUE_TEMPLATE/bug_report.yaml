      Description of the bug. Please include the following:
      - Logs: These will be located in the `logs/` directory of your Minecraft instance. This is always useful, even if it doesn't include errors, so please upload this!
      - Detailed reproduction steps: sometimes I can spot a bug pretty easily, but often it's much more obscure. The more information I have to help reproduce it, the quicker it'll get fixed.
