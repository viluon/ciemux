## A quick checklist
 - If there's a existing issue, please link to it. If not, provide fill out the same information you would in a normal issue - reproduction steps for bugs, rationale for use-case.
 - If you're working on CraftOS, try to write a few test cases so we can ensure everything continues to work in the future. Tests live in `src/test/resources/test-rom/spec` and can be run with `./gradlew check`.
